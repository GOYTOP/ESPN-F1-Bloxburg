        <h3>1. Ferrari</h3></center>
      <center><p>Nobody can deny Ferrari's dominance. Between Lunnos and PreitV are easily on top from being a step above from the competition. They have blown the rest of the teams out the water with their dominance.</p></center>
      <center><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Mercedes_AMG_Petronas_F1_Logo.svg/2560px-Mercedes_AMG_Petronas_F1_Logo.svg.png" height="150"></center>
      <center><h3>2. Mercedes</h3><center>
      <center><p>Mercedes' has been dominant throughout the practices at Jeddah to the Charity Race in Shanghai. Nadaal and Lightning both placed well in qualifying for Jeddah. Mercedes have placed well in almost everything only coming behind Ferrari.</p></center>

        <center><h3>3. Red Bull</h3></center>
        <center><p>Red Bull is a step behind both Ferrari and Mercedes but between Fraken and Daniel they have placed well in everything so far. They still have more to prove and have quality drivers. They are a top team that could easily move up this list.</p></center>
        <center><img src="https://www.visacashapprb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Card-520x650-1.jpg" height="350"></center>
        <center><h3>4. VCARB</h3></center>
        <center><p>Mikhail, Cammy, and Stella have all performed throughout the races and practices so far. Many have doubts if they can keep doing good in races. They have shown quality throughout qualifying, races, and practices.</p></center>
        <center><img src="https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/3WWeox/s3/aston-martin-new-logo.jpg" height="250"></center>
        <center><h3>5. Aston Martin</h3></center>
        <center><p>Both Lethal and Jake Morgan both placed well in qualifying for Jeddah. They have showed their strengths but they are not on the level of Ferrari, Mercedes, Red Bull, and VCARB. Aston Martin could easily join the 4 in the dominance.</p></center>
        <center><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/66/McLaren_Racing_logo.svg/1280px-McLaren_Racing_logo.svg.png" height="150"></center>
        <center><h3>6. Mclaren</h3></center>
        <center><p>Mclaren has not been able to show their strengths to the fullest extent. Simply and Real_Perfect are good drivers but they have not had the chance to show their full work. They have placed well when they have had the opportunity</p></center>
        <center><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Haas_F1_Team_Logo.svg/2560px-Haas_F1_Team_Logo.svg.png" height="150"></center>
        <center><h3>7. Haas</h3></center>
        <center><p>Haas and Alpine are very similar in the fact that one of their drivers is shining and the other is in their shadow. Baron has shown how good he is throughout the various races and practice while Cyder has not been able to do the same.</p></center>
        <center><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Alpine_F1_Team_Logo.svg/2233px-Alpine_F1_Team_Logo.svg.png" height="150"></center>
        <center><h3>8. Alpine</h3></center>
        <center><p>Alpine is in a very similar situation as Haas where Jbits is outshining TJ by a heavy margin. They could very easily move very high in these rankings if TJ could show his skills this weekend.</p></center>
        <center><img src="https://mcstaging.williamsf1.com/media/logo/stores/1/williams-f1-logo.png" height="125"></center>
        <center><h3>9. Williams</h3></center>
        <center><p>Williams has not yet been able to show their work so far. Flash and Rue are capable of doing a lot better than they have been. It seems they are under performing compared to the rest of the teams.</p></center>
        <center><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Logo_of_Stake_F1_Team_Kick_Sauber.png" height="200"></center>
        <center><h3>10. Kick Sauber</h3></center>
        <center><p>They have been a solid step below every other team. They are not performing at all. Sy and Benny have not looked good at all when they are on the track. They have not placed well in any of the events so far.</p></center>
